## Rules:
By using the command `git push public <branch>`, stuff can be publised to the original DIKUArcade
at https://github.com/diku-dk/DIKUArcade/. __THIS IS HIGHLY DISCOURAGED__

By using the command `git pull public master`, the latest changes from the engine can be fetched.
_Always do this whenever the original is changed._

This repository is meant to be private. __NEVER MAKE IT PUBLIC__.
Also, invite only people, who can be trusted and who has already passed the SoftwareDevelopment course
at DIKU.
