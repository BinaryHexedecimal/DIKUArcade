CONSIDERATIONS:
+ Is the new key transformer system well-designed?
  + Yes, Boris seems to think so.
* Can window clear color be transparent? Otherwise overloads for SetClearColor with alpha must be removed!
* Do we want GameEventType as function argument next to GameEvent, or can we simply contain it inside the GameEvent? (cleaner, right now much confusion)
* Optimize DIKUArcade.Events.GameEventBus.RegisterTimedEvent to not create a new list every time. (list double-buffering is considered a viable solution)


TESTING:
* Removing resize handler multiple times in a row, and similar tests!
* Transparent window framebuffer! (Ubuntu: proper desktop manager, not I3)
* Changes in DIKUArcade.Window.DefaultResizeHandler()
