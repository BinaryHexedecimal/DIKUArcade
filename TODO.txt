CONSIDERATIONS:
* Is the new key transformer system well-designed?
* Can window clear color be transparent? Otherwise overloads for SetClearColor with alpha must be removed!


TESTING:
* Removing resize handler multiple times in a row, and similar tests!
* Transparent window framebuffer! (Ubuntu: proper desktop manager, not I3)
* Changes in DIKUArcade.Window.DefaultResizeHandler()
